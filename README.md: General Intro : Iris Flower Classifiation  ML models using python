# Iris flower classification 

The Iris Flower dataset was used, consisting of 150 samples with features for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, classified into three species of Iris flowers. 
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a machine learning model that can accurately classify Iris flowers into their respective species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on physical characteristics such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

# Principle:
Using machine learning algorithms, predict the species by:
> Analyzing feature patterns and relationships
> Training models on labeled data
> Evaluating model performance using accuracy metrics

# Key Concepts:
> EDL
> Supervised Learning
> Classification Algorithms ( Logistic Regression & SVM)
> Model Evaluation ( Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)
